  * clutter/eglx/clutter-eglx-texture-pixmap.c,
    clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c:

    'pixmap freeing' in x11tfp, and use it in eglxtfp to destroy the surface
    before the pixmap is freed.

    Was changed for maemo63, but including bug number for this release.
  * clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Rolled back changes for NB#149943, apart from
    some minor improvements.

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo63) unstable; urgency=low

  * clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c: Change default stage size to 800x480.
    This is ugly, but stops the strange half-blanking effect on startup.
  * clutter/clutter-timeline.c: Fixes NB#149943 - non-linear animations. Yet
    more messing around - this intentionally renders the first few frames
    assuming time is running slowly to get around the initial delay as
    things get added to the SGX pipeline.

  *  clutter/eglx/clutter-eglx-texture-pixmap.c/h
     clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c/h: Fixes NB#141778 - EGLX backend
     does not implement realize. Remove the overridden_paint elements, as we 
     can just access the parent class directly, implement realise in eglx tfp.

  * clutter/cogl/cogl.h.in
    clutter/cogl/gl/cogl-texture.c
    clutter/cogl/gl/cogl.c: Fixes #4870 on bugs.maemo.org (original patch by
    javispedro) - Sometimes colour channels swapped in X86 scratchbox. Remove 
    packed_pixel check, as it was broken in many ways, and now just assume we
    are using GL1.2, as this is shipped by default with the maemo development
    kit. So now we don't do the conversion so it's faster, and the bug doesn't
    manifest itself any more.

  * for NB#149132: rm -rf usr/share/doc in package creation time on armel.

  * Misc regression fix - when run in debug mode clutter asserts on every 
    click. != vs == issue
  * Fixes: NB#145902 - Clicking the dashboard icon highlights it but does not
    open the dashboard
  * We skipped the only motion event between the ButtonPress and ButtonRelease
    because of event throttling.  The skipped motion which would have generated
    the leave-event which would have dehighlighted the tasks button.
  * clutter/clutter-main.c (clutter_do_event):
    generate_enter_leave_events() (if any) for button events too.
  * clutter/clutter-main.c (generate_enter_leave_events):
    Modified the signature accordingly.

  Gordon:
  * clutter/clutter-main.c/h
    clutter/clutter-private.h: Added code to handle Software selection for the
    most common cases (off by default). This saves the delay caused by repeated
    draws and redraws on SGX.

  Gordon:
  * clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.h
  * clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c : Removed automatic redirecting
    code as this couldn't be turned off and was causing flicker and pain on 
    composite non-composite changes. Also makes us more like upstream clutter.
  * clutter/x11/clutter-stage-x11.c: remove forced redraw on _show, as it 
    never worked anyway (redraw before a map doesn't update anything)
  * clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c: Replace unnecessary XGrabServer
    with XSync.

  * clutter/cogl/common/cogl-pvr-texture-gl.c: Fix some stupid bugs meaning
    that PVR textures were leaked.

    of the texture, so we always free it (even on resize).

    FBO.

  Gordon:
  Fixes for NB#142006 - CallUI doesn't update orientation when screen is off
  Small bugfix allowing us to stop redraws for screen blanking while not
  conflicting with what we do for rotation.
  * clutter/clutter-actor.c: clutter_actor_get_stage_if_allow_redraw now
    checks the allow_redraw flag on the stage.
  * clutter/clutter-stage.c: Removed shaped_mode return in paint, as it is too
    late if we ever get to this point (screen has been cleared + will be
    flipped)

  * clutter/clutter-stage.c (clutter_stage_paint): Move setting of the
    CLUTTER_ACTOR_IN_PAINT flag to after the shaped mode check.
    (redraw_update_idle): Do not draw onto the screen in shaped mode.

  Gordon:
  * clutter/clutter-main.c
    clutter/clutter-main.h
    clutter/clutter-private.h: Add extra function called 
    clutter_grab_pointer_without_pick. This allows input events to be received
    but ensures that clutter does not do picking in order to find which actor
    is under the cursor. Also removed un-needed glFinish for picking (syncing 
    should be done in GLES) and increased clutter motion events frequency.

  Adam:

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo46) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixes: NB#134034 - Blue screen observed in various scenarios
           Also allows single-buffering to work passably and 
  * clutter/clutter-main.c: set DOUBLE_BUFFER=0 as we don't need to write to
    such a large area while eglSwapBuffers uses blitting rather than flipping.
    Do picking by restricting drawing to just a single pixel, which we replace
    with the old color afterwards (previously we would write to the entire 
    screen, and then set the whole area as 'damaged').
  * clutter/clutter-stage.c: Now don't set the whole screen areas as damaged

  Gordon:
    Fixes: NB#113278 - choppy playback when notification arrives
  * clutter/clutter-actor.c: Made allow_redraw act on children as well (so we

    causing redraw if nothing has changed.

  Gordon:
  * clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c (on_x_event_filter_too): Update

  * Fixes: NB#131303 - clutter_eglx_texture_pixmap_surface_create takes too
    long
  * Speed improvements
    clutter/eglx/clutter-eglx-texture-pixmap.c: Speed improvements for pixmap
    create/destroy (70ms -> 26ms). Remove calls to eglQuerySurface that aren't
    actually required, only re-allocate pixmap texture just before rendering -
    which means we will do it less, but also when XServer is less busy and we 
    will stall less.

    clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.h: added a set_allow_alpha function

  Speedups based on profiling

  * clutter/clutter-actor.c: Disable visibility detection by default - we must
    enable it explicitly for actors in hildon-desktop now
  * clutter/clutter-fixed.h: Now use macro rather than inline asm function -
    this produces much better assembler for cogl_util_mtx_transform
  * clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c: slight unroll + big speedup for
    cogl_gles2_wrapper_mult_matrix, also special case for cogl_translatex
    which accounted for most of the cogl_gles2_wrapper_mult_matrix calls.
  * clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-texture.c: changed 'if !cogl_is_texture' to
    g_return_if_fail, as we don't want these runtime checks, and 
    cogl_is_texture is *very* slow (linear search)
  * clutter/clutter-private.h: added blank #define for g_object_freeze_notify
    and g_object_thaw_notify, as these caused excessive slowness and we don't
    need threading support.

  Kimmo:
  * clutter/clutter-stage.[ch]: Added clutter_stage_set_shaped_mode for
    non-composited mode.
  * Add -O2 compilation flag.

  * clutter/eglx/clutter-stage-egl.c: Changed depth to 24 bits. THIS REQUIRES
    THE NEW KERNEL

  Plugged leaks found by Coverity:
  * clutter/cogl/common/cogl-bitmap.c (cogl_bitmap_save_pvrtc4): Free
    pointer 'compressed'.
  * clutter/cogl/common/cogl-pvr-texture.c (cogl_pvr_texture_load): fclose()
    'texfile' in case of a return because of an error. Free 'texture_data' in
    one error return.
  * clutter/x11/clutter-backend-x11.c (_clutter_x11_register_xinput): Free
    pointer 'ext' and 'xdevices'.
  * clutter/x11/clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c (try_alloc_shm): Free
    dummy_image.
    (clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_update_area_real): Added NULL check for
    an XGetImage call. Free 'image' in case of some error cases.
  * Removed some old debug prints.
  * clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-fixed-fragment-shader.glsl (.h/.c genereated), 
    clutter/cogl/gles/cogl-gles2-wrapper.c:
    Do to not multiply the texture's colour by the current colour if our
    colour is white (95% of cases). Gives us ~5% speed increase.

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo15) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Adam Endrodi's patch for DestroyNotify events causing the pixmap 
    to be destroyed in x11-texture-pixmap
  * Added FIXED_TO_INT_ROUND to round to the nearest(ish) integer rather than
    just clipping. Was to fix FP inaccuracies in the set_clip code
  * Modified GLES cogl-texture to skip allocation and copying to an 
    intermediate bitmap if row strides match properly. Also use glTexImage2D
    if not copying a sub-area, but the whole image.
  * Pierre-Luc Beaudoin's patch to disable frame skipping to allow easier
    profiling of clutter.

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo14) unstable; urgency=low

  * Modified clutter_stage_redraw_damage so that the stage can be redrawn with
    a delay - which helps get rid of multiple redraws when we get >1 XDamage
    events within a few ms of each other. Currently this is set to 0 delay as 
    we found it didn't help much.
  * Added CLUTTER_TEXTURE_FLAG_16_BIT to force 16 bit textures in 
    set_from_rgb_data
  * Added clutter_x11_texture_pixmap_add_shape to deal with transparency in
    textures via XShapeGetRectangles    
  * Modified eglx_texture_pixmap to try creating a texture with alpha before
    it creates one without - this solves the transparent window issue on device
  * removed warning from GL/cogl.c
  * quick fix to get update area working on scratchbox
  * Added a whole load of floating point matrix functions to stop the 
    inaccuracies that were corrupting the screen in update_area calls. 
  * Added code to draw a black rectangle with a red border for any window that
    doesn't have a pixmap (as opposed to just spamming stdout)

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo13) unstable; urgency=low

  * added cogl_modify_clip_viewport to allow rendering to a specific area (gw)
  * Modified redraw_damage code to allow redraw using viewport rather than 
    glScissor (gw)
  * Stopped eglx-texture-pixmap from creating a new texture on ANY change event, 
    and instead do it only when width/height/depth changes (gw)
  * Set up xevent handlers in clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c only if
    XDAMAGE_HANDLING is defined. This avoids doing damage handling twice for
    application windows and should avoid some surprises in libmatchbox2 side
    (kh).
  * Do not alter XComposite redirections in clutter-x11-texture-pixmap.c, that
    belongs to the window manager (kh).
  * Removed some un-needed log messages for EGLX textures (gw)
  * Set damage to update the whole screen after a 'pick' event (as it will have
    destroyed the buffer)
  * Commented out extra code that caused clutter to not compile with -Werror
  * Reinstated XDamage and XComposite as something in it reverted bug 95594 
    (and multiple XDamage shouldn't be an issue with the next bunch of work
    I'm working on).

  * Added clutter_stage_set_damaged_area to allow redraw of only damaged areas
  * Added clutter_actor_set_visibility_detect to skip visibility detection on
    stuff that doesn't play fair - like h-d task navigator
  * Added clutter_actor_queue_redraw_damage to allow a redraw to be queued
    without the whole screen being marked as damaged.

  * Added PVRTC4 Texture compressor + decompressor
  * Added PVR decompressor fallback for loading PVRs on GL
  * Removed optional PVR loading code from clutter-texture
  * Made cogl-texture understand and load .pvr files
  * added cogl_bitmap_save_pvrtc4 to save compressed pvr file 
    so it can be used for h-d backgrounds
  * added extra 1 byte per pixel texture formats to 
    clutter_texture_set_from_rgb_data for gaussian shadows in
    matchbox
  * Removed visibility check for redraw as I think it adds more trouble
    than it solves
  * Added null-pointer check for container sort
  * Exposed cogl_blend_func to let tidy-blur-group work properly
    with transparent textures
  * Removed 'updating texture' messages fom EGL TFP
  * Fixed several warnings throughout the code
  * added more useful debug message to EGL TFP
  * Kimmo: Add check before queuing a paint in update_area in EGL TFP.
  * Kimmo: Use new libgles2 and libgles2-dev packages.

clutter (0.8.2-0maemo10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added cogl-pvr-texture file to allow GLES to load PVR compressed textures
    if they exist
  * Replaced stencil-based clipping with WAY faster scissor-based clipping
    for the case where we're clipping to rectangles
  * Removed instantiation of surfaces with a stencil buffer for GLES
    as we won't need it now
  * Moved matrix functions from clutter-actor to cogl-util (+ added unproject)
  * Added stencil area to visibility detection so we don't even ask
    GLES to draw outside clipping regions (eg. for lists)
  * Modified pixel shaders to use lowp (int10) where possible instead of
    mediump (float16)
  * Now compile with Werror and modified some code accordingly
  * Added code to allow notification of modification of children to parent
    containers - used when a texture is used in a container to cache the 
    state of its children (specifically tidy-blur-group in h-d)
  * Modified COGL to add cogl_texture_triangles to allow fast drawing on GLES
  * Modified Pango Renderer to use one call to cogl_texture_triangles rather
    than many calls to cogl_texture_rectangle
  * Modified cogl-bitmap-pixbuf to only use a single memcpy on load rather than
    one per scanline
